Description
===========

Models from which various design problems can be built

In-plane
--------

*   model_I: ports to the left and right.
*   model_V: one port to the left, and N ports to the right.
*   model_H: N ports to the left, and N ports to the right.

Some optional models.

*   model_X: ports above, below, left, and right (optional).
*   model_T: ports above, left, and right (optional).


Out-of-plane
------------

*   model_L: fiber-to-waveguide coupling problem.
*   model_U: reflection/transmission between out-of-plane modes.
*   model_Y: concentration to a point in-plane.
