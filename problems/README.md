Description
-----------

A collection of nanophotonic design problems that can be solved.

Most design problems are derived from models which provide 
a basic problem layout.
Furthermore, some of these models are based on 
a small set of standard waveguides.


Problem specification
---------------------

*   The opt_prob structure is the primary specification created by each problem.
